              I was once young, thinking I was on top of the world. I was hanging out with the wrong crowd.
              I made a lot of bad decisions. This caused me to lose my day job, which led to an an even deeper
              downward spiral. I wasn't able to afford dental care, so I eventually lost all of my teeth. I realized
              I hit a low point when I realized I was doing basic tricks for treats for strangers on the street.
              I had to do something to get my life together.

              I eventually got myself together, and enrolled in school. I decided to go into Law to try to help young
              pups stay off the path I went on. This is a picture of me with one of my fraternity brothers. His frat
              name is not appropriate to display here. The men I met in the frat, and the people I met at school, helped
              me immensely at achieving my goal of attaining my Law degree. Without them, I wouldn't be where I am today.
              Some of them helped me through some dark times where I almost fell back to old habits.

              After spending a few years as a lawyer, this is my first day as a judge. The guy in the picture is one of my 
              frat brothers, Flounder, who was in the area and decided to help me celebrate. I hope for many good years to come.
              My support network might not be exactly local, but it is strong. Yes, I still have not replaced my teeth. It helps 
              me remember my past.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another reason I haven't gotten new teeth, is because the kids seem to enjoy it. Outside of my daytime job as a judge,
              I do outreach programs to help stop the young ones from going down the same paths I did. They are the future, and
              need to be set in the right direction.
