Project 1 requirements(will format better later):
```
Project 1. 

Due June 21, Friday (midnight). 
This first (warm-up) project requires you to develop your personal homepage (future projects will be based on this one by incrementally adding and enriching contents, styles, and functions.). Specific requirements are as follows:
1. You must use a plain text editor such as Windows notepad, WordPad, etc. and produce “clean” web pages (more generally referred to as web documents), i.e., without any unintended tags/contents that are typically automatically generated and added to the source files of your webpage if you use a non-plain editor such as MS Word (in other words, do not use MS Word and the like to edit and then save as web pages – that’s
cheating and can be very easily identified). This requirement applies to this and all future projects of this course.
2. Follow the coding standard and conventions introduced in chapter 2.
3. Your home page shall include the following contents accordingly formulated using suitable HTML tags and CSS style files (via an external CSS file): A sketchy bio of you, one profile image of you (using <figure> with embedded <img> tag), one (or more) of your favorite mottos (using <blockquote>, <q>, <cite> at your choice), a list of your photos (e.g., taken from a recent trip to some interesting place) (Here is example code for a single photo link:
 <a href="../html-link.htm">
   <img src="flower.jpg" width="82" height="86" title="White flower" alt="Flower">
 </a>)
4. You must use these organizational tags: section, article, aside, nav (could be used for your photo list), header, footer.
5. You are encouraged to use as many tags so far covered by the posted slides as you like (At the beginning of each set of posted slides there is an outline of the covered tags) and go beyond my above requirement (which is the minimum). But you are discouraged to use other tags we have not addressed (to be reserved for next project) even though you may already be familiar with.
6. Submit your project (all files) as a single zipped file in the corresponding assignment folder at D2L (our course’s website) before the due time.
7. Note: the integrity of your multiple files especially the embedded links must be carefully maintained (broken links will cause you to lose points when I download and test your project).
