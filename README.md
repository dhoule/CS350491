# CS350_491
This is the a project for CS 350/491. It will be a continual project. 

Project 1 requirements:
```
Project 1. 

Due June 21, Friday (midnight). 
This first (warm-up) project requires you to develop your personal homepage (future projects will be based on this one by incrementally adding and enriching contents, styles, and functions.). Specific requirements are as follows:
1. You must use a plain text editor such as Windows notepad, WordPad, etc. and produce “clean” web pages (more generally referred to as web documents), i.e., without any unintended tags/contents that are typically automatically generated and added to the source files of your webpage if you use a non-plain editor such as MS Word (in other words, do not use MS Word and the like to edit and then save as web pages – that’s
cheating and can be very easily identified). This requirement applies to this and all future projects of this course.
2. Follow the coding standard and conventions introduced in chapter 2.
3. Your home page shall include the following contents accordingly formulated using suitable HTML tags and CSS style files (via an external CSS file): A sketchy bio of you, one profile image of you (using <figure> with embedded <img> tag), one (or more) of your favorite mottos (using <blockquote>, <q>, <cite> at your choice), a list of your photos (e.g., taken from a recent trip to some interesting place) (Here is example code for a single photo link:
 <a href="../html-link.htm">
   <img src="flower.jpg" width="82" height="86" title="White flower" alt="Flower">
 </a>)
4. You must use these organizational tags: section, article, aside, nav (could be used for your photo list), header, footer.
5. You are encouraged to use as many tags so far covered by the posted slides as you like (At the beginning of each set of posted slides there is an outline of the covered tags) and go beyond my above requirement (which is the minimum). But you are discouraged to use other tags we have not addressed (to be reserved for next project) even though you may already be familiar with.
6. Submit your project (all files) as a single zipped file in the corresponding assignment folder at D2L (our course’s website) before the due time.
7. Note: the integrity of your multiple files especially the embedded links must be carefully maintained (broken links will cause you to lose points when I download and test your project).
```

Project 2 requirements:
```
Project 2. Due July 1, Monday (midnight). Based/continuing on Project 1, add the following features and elements:
1. Add a table with daily (roughly by hours) or weekly (by days) schedule (whichever makes the most sense with regard to your actual situation for the summer). Try to use a bigger variety (if not all) of table related tags and features.
2. Use layout tables (which mimic tables but are not real tables) to rearrange your travel photos (can use slide 16 of Chapt5 as a sample).
3. Add your favorite music audio and video clips (addressed in Chapt7).
4. Add a feedback form soliciting visitor’s comments and signing in contact book. You shall use a variety of form widgets (most of them are addressed in Chapt8) gathering visitor information such as name, address, phone, email, and comments, etc. using suitable form elements, verify the validity of user input instantly using client-side JavaScript event handlers (also addressed in Chapt8), and send a “Thank You” replay email upon form submission (no server-side coding required for this project).
5. Accordingly enrich your CSS styles (maintain the externa CSS file, while some style elements may be handily put inline of the html files).
6. Submission requirement (Must Be Rigidly Followed): Name your project 2 folder as Project2, have all your project files located in it (can have subfolders), name your main webpage file as “index.htm”, change to the upper (parent) folder, zip the whole folder “Project2” (including all subfolders if any), rename your zipped (single) file as “last_name-first_name.Project2.zip” such as mine “Che-Daren-Project2.zip”, upload to the submission folder at course’s website.
7. Grading scale: get 80% if basic (explicitly described) requirements are met; the remaining 20% is at the instructor’s discretion according to professionalism, aesthetic, and the implied effort (These are hard to be put in a specific requirement).
8. Tips to get maximum score: Think in a professional way, do a little more than the basic requirement, be thoughtful and creative. Maximally satisfy/please the potential users/ visitors (to your webpage) – I am one of them.
